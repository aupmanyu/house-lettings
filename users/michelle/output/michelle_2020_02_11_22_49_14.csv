There are also Paragon Gardens as well as Victory Community Park and St Mary rsquo;s Churchyard nearby. A little further walk is Burgess Park with it rsquo;s period buildings, gardens, lake and tennis courts.A little history:Bricklayers Arms Recreational Park is situated just off the A2 on Mandela Way. This outside public space is renowned for having a World War 2 Soviet T-34 tank. It is a derelict and bizarre landmark that turns many a passing head. There is much speculation as to how this war machine ended up at this location. The story goes that a local resident was refused planning permission to build by Southwark Council. The legend has it that in 1995 the resident purchased the de-activated tank from a military salvage dealer in Kent for  pound;7,000. It was then placed on the now-derelict plot of land, with it rsquo;s gun pointing in the direction of the Southwark Council offices. Artist were allowed to paint the tank in more recent years. The T-34 tank was used to crush the Prague Spring revolution in August 1968. It was then brought to Britain from Czechoslovakia in the early 1990s and was used in filming scenes in Battersea for award winning film Richard III starring Ian Mc Kellen. The tank has been featured in the guide book Derelict London by Paul Talling
